# Juice

2nd project that I've done in React, can be tested [here](https://juice-ascent.netlify.com/).

It's inspired by the game [Game of Thrones Ascent](https://www.disruptorbeam.com/games/game-of-thrones-ascent/) (now over). Images are from the [fan wiki](https://gotascent.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page).

### How to play

Just click on the round button to manually produce Juice. Earn enough Juice to be able to unlock the first building.

Buy ressources by clicking the image of the ressource (a faded image means you don't own the necessary ressources).

Hovering over the ressource name displays the requirements in a pop-up.

Ressources will auto-produce Juice, you can see the production in the pop-up.

You can buy workers by using the '+' button, and sell them with the '-' button. A worker will auto-buy the associated ressource if the requirements are completed.

### Good to know

This project is far from perfect, and code may not be as clean as it should be given my absence of professional experience in web development.

However, it shows what I've learned on my own in a few weeks.
